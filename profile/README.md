FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is a security feature introduced by Google for Android devices running version 5.1 (Lollipop) and above. It protects the device from unauthorized access after a reset by asking for the Google account that was previously synced on the phone. While this is useful in preventing theft, it can also be a challenge if the user forgets their credentials.
